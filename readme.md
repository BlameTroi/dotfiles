# troi's dotfiles

Just a collection of my various dot and configuration
files. I keep this in the directory ~/dotfiles/ and
then plant symlinks to point to these master files.

Under vim I am keeping several plugins under source
control even though I should probably ignore them.

After some experimentation I have gone back to vim from
neovim. Too many cursor problems. The nvim.init.vim file
under vim/ should be renamed to init.vim in a neovim
environment.

Window manager and X support included. I use xterm and
i3wm at present.
